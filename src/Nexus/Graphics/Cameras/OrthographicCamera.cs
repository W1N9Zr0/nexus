	/// This class specifies an orthogonal projection of a 3-D model to a 2-D visual surface. Like PerspectiveCamera, it specifies a position, 
	/// viewing direction, and "upward" direction. Unlike PerspectiveCamera, however, OrthographicCamera describes a projection that does 
	/// not include perspective foreshortening. In other words, OrthographicCamera describes a viewing box whose sides are parallel, 
	/// instead of one whose sides meet in a point at the scene's horizon.
